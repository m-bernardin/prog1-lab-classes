This project is part of the material for the book

It is discussed in chapter 1.

The purpose of this project is to illustrate object interaction and to examine
some simple code. See chapters one and three of the book.

To use this project, create some Student objects, then create a LabClass object.
Add the students to the class using the "enrolStudent" method. Print a class
list.

part v
getName is checking the string entered when the student object was created
it checks how many student objects are associated with that labClass object, not usre how though
set a time, instructor, and room for LabClass object printList(); returns all info as expected 
int, string, int, int, boolean, string, double
add a block like 'private String name;" to the class, at the top with other field definitions
'public String send()'
'   private int number1;
    private int number2;
    public int average( int number1, int number2)
    {
        return number1;
    }'
its an object, its class is its title
not that i understand, an object seem to be a copy of a class that can be worked on, however a class can inherit things from other classes, which could mean that an object of the first class shares the inherited classes
